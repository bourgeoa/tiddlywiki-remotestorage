## Save your tiddlers to [remoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io/)!

Works anywhere, just grab the plugin on [$:/plugins/fiatjaf/remoteStorage](https://tiddly.alhur.es/#%24%3A%2Fplugins%2Ffiatjaf%2FremoteStorage), save, reload, optionally change your preferences on [$:/plugins/fiatjaf/remoteStorage/config](https://tiddly.alhur.es/#%24%3A%2Fplugins%2Ffiatjaf%2FremoteStorage) and you'll be good to go.

Your tiddlers will be saved on `/public/tiddlers/<chosen-namespace>/`.

  * `<chosen-namespace>` defaults to `"main"`.

## Just start using it now

If you're just starting a new TiddlyWiki you don't have to bother installing anything, just visit https://tiddly.alhur.es/ and start writing. Changes will be saved locally, but you can login anytime to a remoteStorage account and your tiddlers will be saved automatically there.
